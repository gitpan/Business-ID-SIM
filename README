NAME
    Business::ID::SIM - Validate Indonesian driving license number (nomor
    SIM)

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
     use Business::ID::SIM qw(parse_sim);

     my $res = parse_sim(sim => "0113 40 00 0001");

DESCRIPTION
    This module can be used to validate Indonesian driving license number,
    Nomor Surat Izin Mengemudi (SIM).

    SIM is composed of 12 digits as follow:

     yymm.pp.aa.ssss

    yy and mm are year and month of birth, pp and aa are area code
    (province+district of some sort), ssss is 4-digit serial most probably
    starting from 1.

    Note that there are several kinds of SIM (A, B1, B2, C) but this is not
    encoded in the SIM number and all SIM's have the same number.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  parse_sim(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   sim* => *str*

        Input to be parsed.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
